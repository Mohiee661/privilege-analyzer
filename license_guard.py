"""
License Guard — embedded in every tool to enforce copyright.

What it does:
  1. Verifies LICENSE file exists and hasn't been tampered with
  2. Checks that the copyright notice is intact
  3. Prints attribution on every run
  4. Prevents execution if LICENSE is missing or modified

This is NOT DRM — it's a tamper-evident seal. If someone removes the
LICENSE file or strips the copyright, the tool refuses to start.
This is legal and standard practice for proprietary-licensed OSS.
